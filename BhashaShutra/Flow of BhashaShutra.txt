To implement this flow for BhashaShutra, you can follow these steps:

1. Layout Design:
Header:
The header should have the title "BhashaShutra" in a fiery yellow and red color combination. For this, you can use a gradient or a vibrant design in CSS or styling libraries.
BS in a Circle:
In the top left corner, place the initials "BS" inside a circle. The circle should be blue, and the text "BS" should be green in bold italic form.
2. Main Display:
Create four buttons for the file types: CSV, TXT, Word, and DOC.
Use appropriate symbols for each file type (e.g., a CSV symbol for CSV, a document icon for TXT, etc.)
Once a user clicks a button, they can choose a file from the system.
3. File Handling:
CSV/Excel Files:
If the file is a CSV or Excel file, you display its content on the main page and show the message "Features coming soon."

TXT/Word Files:
For TXT and DOC files, load the content, and in the sidebar, display various text-processing options as checkboxes:

Remove HTML tags
Remove URLs
Convert text to lowercase
Remove punctuation
Chat word treatment
Spelling correction
Remove stopwords
Emoji handling
Sentence tokenization
Word tokenization
Perform stemming
Perform lemmatization
Exit to Main Menu
4. Checkbox Interaction:
When a user selects a checkbox, the corresponding text transformation should apply dynamically to the displayed content in the main area.
For example, if the "Convert text to lowercase" box is selected, the content on the screen should automatically convert to lowercase.
Each time a checkbox is selected, the transformation will stack. If multiple boxes are ticked, the respective transformations will be applied in sequence.
As each transformation is applied, the changes should reflect immediately on the displayed text.
5. File Actions (Share, View, Download):
After applying the transformations, provide the following options for the user:
Share the file: Share via a URL or email.
View the file: Open the transformed file directly for viewing.
Download the file: Download the transformed file, which should be named something like transformed_filename (the user can input the name).
6. Example Flow:
The user uploads a TXT file.
The sidebar displays checkboxes for text-processing options.
The user selects "Convert text to lowercase" and "Remove stopwords".
The text in the main display dynamically changes to lowercase and removes stopwords.
The user can click on the Share, View, or Download buttons to manage the transformed file.
7. Implementation Details:
Use JavaScript (for dynamic transformation) or a Python web framework like Flask or Django for the backend.
For text transformations:
Remove HTML Tags: Use regex to remove tags.
Remove URLs: Use regex to find and remove URLs.
Lowercase: .lower() method in Python.
Remove Punctuation: Use string.punctuation and str.translate() method.
Stopwords Removal: Use NLTK or spaCy library to remove common stopwords.
Spelling Correction: Use libraries like TextBlob or SpellChecker.
Lemmatization/Stemming: Use NLTK or spaCy for word processing.
